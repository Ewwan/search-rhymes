    <div>
        <p>In the following exercise I have incorporated the boilerplate code for an AJAX request to the <a href="https://www.datamuse.com/api/">Datamuse API</a> to search for words that rhyme! Next, I have taken steps to refactor and improve the code's readability and it's execution which led to using fetch(), and finally <strong><em>async...await</em></strong> GET Request.</p>

        <p>The application is a part of the study series and has been created only for learning purposes. The aim of this exercise is to create an AJAX request and refactoring the code in the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>using an XHR object to make a GET request</li>
            <li>refactoring the code by incorporating <strong>fetch()</strong> GET Request</li>
            <li>simplifying the request using <strong><em>async...await</em></strong> GET Request</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Type in a word in English in the input field and click the submit button. The response field in the browser will display the response from the API with the maximum of 10 corresponding rhymes!</p><br />
