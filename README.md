<wbr/>
    <div>
        <p>In the following exercise I have incorporated the boilerplate code for an AJAX request using an XHR object to make a GET request to the Datamuse API to search for words that rhyme!</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Type in a word in English in the input field and click the submit button. The response field in the browser will display the response from the API with the maximum of 10 corresponding rhymes!</p><br />
